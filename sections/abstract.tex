   In this report, we explore the possibility of predicting the next day average price of the cryptocurrency known as \textbf{Ether}. In the first part, we explore a pure time series analysis using \textbf{classical decomposition} in combination with machine learning techniques for one step forecast; specifically, we tested  \textbf{Ridge regression} and \textbf{Multilayer Perceptron}. On the second part, we included social media sentiment extracted from \textbf{Twitter} and \textbf{Google trends} to try to capture human greed and collective fear on the final price. To increase the interpretability of the second part, we only used \textbf{Boosting with Regression Trees}.\\
